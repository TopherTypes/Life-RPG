# LifeRPG

LifeRPG is a personal web app that turns daily self-tracking into an RPG-like progression system.

## Vision
LifeRPG exists to improve **consistency and habit building** through a simple daily input flow and rich progress analytics.

Core outcomes:
- Daily self-tracking becomes part of normal routine.
- Users gain motivation from visible progression.
- Users build self-awareness from trend analysis.

## Product Positioning
LifeRPG is designed to be:
- **Simple to log** (3–5 minutes daily).
- **Deep to review** (10–20 minutes for planning and reflection).
- **Solo-first and private-first** (no social layer in MVP/V1).

## Current Scope (MVP)
- Web-only app.
- Manual data entry only.
- LocalStorage as sole persistence.
- No integrations.
- No AI.
- No authentication.

## Primary MVP Metrics

- Mood
- Steps
- Exercise

## High-Level Loop
1. Open app
2. Enter daily data
3. Receive rewards/recap
